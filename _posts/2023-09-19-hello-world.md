## Civic hacking

Civic hacking is the practice of collaboratively designing democracy and coding for good. This form of civic engagement is more important than ever as governments and civil society at large become more digital.

## Civic Hacking Agency

Civic Hacking Agency is testing out a new way to bring youth technologists together to design, code and learn a new way to experience civics.

We'll do this through:

* Meetups: Pitch, code and demo civic-focused projects.
* Guest talks: Engage with civic technology experts and leaders. 

## Who's it for?

Lamorinda (Lafayette / Moraga / Orinda) high school students interested in civics and technology (and are into coding). 

## How this started

The idea for CHA began after Luke (father) and Elias (son) Fretwell started coding together during the pandemic. [Learn more about our story.](https://www.govtech.com/civic/a-young-civic-hacker-could-be-the-next-generation-of-gov-tech)
