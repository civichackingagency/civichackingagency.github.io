Data is Plural reported on our [gov metadata project](/projects/gov-metadata):

> Dot-gov metadata. Father-son duo Luke and Elias Fretwell are grading government websites’ metadata. Starting with a dataset of 1,300+ federal domains maintained by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Fretwells have tested whether each homepage’s source code includes a <title> tag, certain Open Graph markers, and other key HTML metadata, which “can have a significant impact on how citizens experience government digital services.” The results, presented online in the form of report cards, can also be downloaded.
