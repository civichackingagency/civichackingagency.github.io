## Civic hacking

Civic hacking is the practice of collaboratively designing democracy and coding for good. 

## Civic Hacking Agency

CHA is focused on connecting youth technologists with a new way of doing civics.

We do this through:

* Regular meetups
* Guest talks

CHA was started after Luke (father) and Elias (son) Fretwell started coding together during the pandemic. [Learn more about our story.](https://www.govtech.com/civic/a-young-civic-hacker-could-be-the-next-generation-of-gov-tech)
