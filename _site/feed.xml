<blockquote>
  <p>The new government website evaluation tool, which is called “gov metadata,” was created by Luke Fretwell and his son, Elias, as part of the Civic Hacking Agency, a project focused on technology for the public good. The system works by scanning government websites and then analyzing the presence of metatags, which can help search engines and other portions of the web to interpret aspects of an online page. A metatag might be a reference to a title or help boost a page’s presence on social media; based on the number of metatags present, the project gives a “score” to each website.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One of the driving goals of this major effort has been to improve the findability and search engine authority of these core sites through strong metadata tooling and training, and we believe this contributed to our report card score,” said Jennifer Dooren, the deputy news chief at NASA headquarters.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Overall, the project appears to provide further incentive to improve site metadata. Several agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Labor, noted the importance of the Civic Hacking Agency’s tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The feedback from the ‘gov metadata’ scoring system is invaluable to us as it helps gauge our performance in implementing basic metadata principles,” said Ryan Honick, a public affairs specialist at the Department of Labor. “It acts as a catalyst for ongoing improvement, driving us to refine our strategies for making our websites as accessible and user-friendly as possible.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dot-gov metadata. Father-son duo Luke and Elias Fretwell are grading government websites’ metadata. Starting with a dataset of 1,300+ federal domains maintained by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Fretwells have tested whether each homepage’s source code includes a <title> tag, certain Open Graph markers, and other key HTML metadata, which “can have a significant impact on how citizens experience government digital services.” The results, presented online in the form of report cards, can also be downloaded.</title></p>

<p>Civic hacking is the practice of collaboratively designing democracy and coding for good. This form of civic engagement is more important than ever as governments and civil society at large become more digital.</p>

<h2 id="civic-hacking-agency">Civic Hacking Agency</h2>

<p>Civic Hacking Agency is testing out a new way to bring technologists together to design, code and learn a new way to experience civics.</p>

<p>We’ll do this through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Meetups: Pitch, code and demo civic-focused projects.</li>
  <li>Guest talks: Engage with civic technology experts and leaders.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whos-it-for">Who’s it for?</h2>

<p>Lamorinda (Lafayette / Moraga / Orinda) high school students interested in civics and technology (and are into coding).</p>

<h2 id="how-this-started">How this started</h2>

<p>The idea for CHA began after Luke (father) and Elias (son) Fretwell started coding together during the pandemic. <a href="https://www.govtech.com/civic/a-young-civic-hacker-could-be-the-next-generation-of-gov-tech">Learn more about our story.</a></p>

<h2 id="join-us">Join us</h2>

<p>We’re now testing interest in an event structure and organization that supports youth technologists interested in civic hacking.</p>
